## Overview

I took on the challenge created by Frontend Mentor to recreate an order summary card component. The challenge was created to help me practice my coding skills by building real live projects.

### The challenge

My challenge was to build out an order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users had to be able to:

- See hover states on interactive elements

## My process

1. Review project brief
2. Have a look at design files
3. Plan how I will action the coding challenege
4. Set up the project files
5. Set up basic styles and HTML Markup
6. Styling with CSS
7. Make card component responsive

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- BEM (Block Elements Modifier)

### Useful resources

- [BEM -Block Elements Modifier](http://getbem.com/) - This helped me name my classes using the BEM Method. I continue to use this as a resource going forward.

- [Nekocalc](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This site was very useful when I needed to convert PX to REM units. I would recommend using this site to convert PX to REM.

- [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) - This article was useful to me, especially when helping me to center the card components. I would continue to use this site as a reference when it comes to centering anything in CSS.
